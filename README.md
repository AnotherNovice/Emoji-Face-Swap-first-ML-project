# Emoji-Face-Swap-ML-project
The goal of this project is to swap human faces with the most visually appropriate emoji, based on the person's detected facial **emotion**.

This is a Python project that combines:
- 🎭 Emotion detection (via DeepFace)
- 🧠 Basic ML pipeline structure
- 🖼️ Face and emoji compositing (via OpenCV)
- 😄 Emoji-matching logic

## Features

- Detects dominant facial **emotion** from an image
- Matches it to a **corresponding emoji**
- Overlays the emoji on the detected **face region**
- Runs **locally** and fast on CPU
- Easy to extend into video or web app
